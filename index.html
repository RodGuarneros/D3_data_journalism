          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income and Poverty</h2>

            <b>America's highest-income states have the fewest health risks, particularly regarding Obesity and Smoking.</b>
          It means that the more income the state has the lower probability of having citizen with obsesity, smokers or without healthcare.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most important explanation to these correlations is related to <b>human capital and better social services</b>, two explicative variables
            that are not represented in this visualization. I mean, if you have a higher income as a state is because you have more human capital and better social services
            and surely this represents better opportunities as well as more tools to avoid health risks. It means more time to practice sports, to eat healthy, and so on, and perhaps better voters in highest-income states.
          </p>
          <p><b>Generally speaking, poor states are those most prone to health risks.</b>This visualization is useful because we are able to identify such states that need an specific effort regarding public policies to mitigate health risks</p>
