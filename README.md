## Objectives

Analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, based on an interactive scatter.

This analysis aims to analyze the health risks facing particular demographics in the US versus demographic facts such as: Income, poverty and age. 

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

The visualization result and analysis is available at:
